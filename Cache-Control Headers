Sometimes customers ask us to add custom expires/cache control headers. Itâ€™s important to be mindful of how we add these.

The following is an example of how to add expires/cache-control headers for common assets. This is just a variation of the rule found in sitename.conf and would essentially overwrite the default assets location block. 
location ~* \.(ogg|ogv|svg|svgz|eot|otf|woff|woff2|mp4|mov|ttf|css|js|jpg|jpeg|gif|png|ico|webp|zip|tgz|gz|rar|bz2|doc|xls|exe|ppt|tar|mid|midi|wav|bmp|rtf)$ {
  expires 1d; #1 day
  add_header cache-control "max-age=86400"; #1 day
  log_not_found off;
  add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';
}
