In case, the client needs to return a 410 (HTTP gone) response to one or more asset, you can use the examples below. Add the rule(s) to the nginx_rules_custom.conf file. As in general, it's best to be as specific as possible to avoid returning 410 for other matching URIs.

single location
###Return 410 for all requests starting with /tests/outdatedcontent/
location ~* "^/tests/outdatedcontent/" { return 410; }

multiple URIs
###Return 410 for all requests in the list.
location ~* "^(/tests/outdatedcontent/|/tests/othercontent/|/somethingelse/)" { return 410; }
